Washington State Democratic Turnout: Machine Learning Analysis

Abstract
This project analyzes county-level demographic and electoral data from Washington State to predict Democratic vote share. Using K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and regression modeling, I demonstrate that demographic age distributions significantly inform electoral outcomes. The PCA-based regression model achieved an in-sample R^2 of approximately 0.85 and a cross-validated R^2 of about 0.49, clearly outperforming a simple mean predictor baseline.

Introduction
Problem Statement: Accurately predicting Democratic turnout across Washington counties is critical for effective allocation of campaign resources and targeted voter outreach strategies.

Audience: This analysis specifically benefits the Washington State Democratic Party. By identifying key demographic predictors and clustering counties based on voter profiles, campaign strategists can efficiently allocate resources to regions with the highest potential impact.

Data Sources
Election Results: I used official Washington State election data from 2024, containing county-level total votes and Democratic vote shares.

Demographic Data: The Washington Office of Financial Management (OFM) provided detailed county-level population breakdowns across multiple age brackets, gender, and racial categories from 2020-2024.

Data Cleaning: There are no significant missing data points across the datasets. All 39 counties provided complete demographic and electoral information.

Data Visualization
Age Distributions: Histograms of the top 8 age/gender/race proportions demonstrated significant variance across counties.

Feature Engineering
Age Proportions: I engineered demographic features by calculating the proportion of each age group relative to county total populations.

Rationale: Age demographics are strong indicators of political participation and partisan preferences, crucial for predicting voter turnout and preferences at the county level.

Clustering & PCA
K-Means Clustering: I employed k-means clustering with an optimal solution of 7 clusters (selected via elbow plot analysis). Clustering revealed distinct demographic profiles across clusters, with notable differences in Democratic vote share (boxplots showed clear cluster differentiation).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA substantially reduced feature complexity. A PCA biplot confirmed clear separation among clusters.

Regression & Evaluation
Baseline Model: A simple model (mean Democratic share) yielded an R^2 of 0.00 and an RMSE of approximately 0.16, indicating minimal predictive power.

PCA-based Regression: Using PC1 and PC2 as predictors, my regression model achieved an R^2 of around 0.85, significantly reducing prediction error compared to the baseline, with an RMSE around 0.06.

Cross-Validation: Five-fold cross-validation provided a robust assessment of generalization, achieving a mean cross-validated R^2 of approximately 0.49 and an RMSE of about 0.12, affirming good model performance beyond training data.

Comparative Analysis: The PCA-based regression model outperformed the trivial baseline predictor, validating the effectiveness and added predictive value of demographic-derived features.

Campaign Implications
K-means Clustering revealed strategic insights:
- Cluster 2 counties show one of the highest average Democratic support (approximately 56.5%). Demographically, these counties have fewer very young children (ages 0-4) and slightly greater racial diversity. Campaign resources should be heavily invested here to maximize Democratic turnout through targeted outreach, emphasizing policies appealing to diverse and established voter bases.
- Cluster 3 averages the second-highest Democratic vote share (about 43.7%). Counties in this cluster are moderately diverse, indicating potential battleground status. Campaign strategy should aim to consolidate and potentially expand Democratic support through inclusive and moderate policy messaging.
- Cluster 5 counties exhibit a similarly strong average Democratic share (approximately 42.0%), reflecting significant potential. Given their demographic similarity to Cluster 3, resources should similarly target inclusive, broad-based messaging and turnout initiatives.
- Clusters 1 and 4 show significantly lower Democratic performance (approximately 27.1% and 26.9% respectively). These counties tend to have higher proportions of very young children and less racial diversity, suggesting more conservative demographics. Campaign investment in these counties might require longer-term community engagement strategies rather than short-term voter-turnout initiatives.
- Cluster 6 represents younger, racially diverse areas with a notable concentration of children and young adults (0-34). It shows elevated shares of Black, Asian, and multiracial populations, lower White representation, and a moderate Democratic vote share (~25.4%). This cluster likely includes growing suburbs or smaller cities with emerging diversity but less entrenched progressive leanings than major urban hubs.
- Cluster 7 captures dense, highly diverse urban centers with the strongest Democratic support (~58.4%). It features balanced age demographics (leaning slightly toward 35-64), very high Black and Asian representation, and minimal White population shares. This cluster typifies progressive strongholds—think major cities like Seattle—where multiracial and NHPI communities thrive, and liberal voting patterns dominate.

PC Insights:
- PC1 primarily differentiates counties based on the proportion of young children (0-4 years). Counties scoring higher on PC1 have fewer young children, suggesting an older or more established demographic. Campaigns can interpret higher PC1 scores as indicators to focus messaging toward older or working-age voters rather than very young family-oriented policies.
- PC2 mainly captures racial diversity among young demographics. Higher PC2 scores indicate counties with relatively fewer young white children and potentially greater proportions of racial minorities among the youth. Targeted messaging for high-PC2 counties should emphasize policies addressing diversity, equity, education, and community inclusiveness to resonate effectively with these voter demographics.

Limitations
Geographic Granularity: County-level data masks within-county variation. Try to leverage precinct-level data in the future.

Additional Data Needs: Using field outreach metrics would further enhance predictive accuracy and actionability.

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that demographic features, especially age-group proportions, substantially inform predictions of Democratic vote share across Washington counties. Utilizing unsupervised clustering, PCA, and supervised regression modeling, I have provided actionable insights for campaign resource allocation. While highly predictive, further refinements through finer geographic data and additional voter-level information could result in even greater precision and impact.
